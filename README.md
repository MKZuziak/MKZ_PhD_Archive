# Description
The following repository contains numerical results and their respective visualisations of all the experiments included in the PhD thesis: Data Collaboration with the Use of Federated Learning: Issues of Marginal Contribution Quantification and Personalisation.
# Structure
Each substantial chapter of the Thesis for which numerical results were produced contains a separate directory:
- Chapter 5 contains results on the Amplified Contribution Analysis for Federated Learning.
- Chapter 6 contains results on the Contribution Metrics in the Context of Re-Identification Attacks.
- Chapter 7 contains results on the Personalisation via One-Shot Clustering for Federated Learning.
